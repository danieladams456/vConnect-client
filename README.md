# vConnect (client application)

The vConnect client application is a C# application built with .NET 4.0. It was created by Troy Cosner and Charlie Snyder for their capstone software engineering project at Liberty University in 2015.

#The application utilizes the following external libraries:
  * [32feet.NET][1] (Bluetooth Library)
  * [NCalc][2] (Mathematical Expressions Evaluator)
  * [Json.NET][3] (JSON framework for .NET)
  
The application was developed to run on a **Windows 7** or **Windows 8** laptop with **Microsoft's Bluetooth Stack**. Outside of these requirements, the application may fail.
